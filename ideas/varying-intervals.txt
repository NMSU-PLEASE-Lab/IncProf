With IncProf we collect data at a fixed interval, but this may not necessarily be the best interval with regards to analyzing the application.

Idea: group data into larger intervals until the analysis is "optimal"

1. run clustering, elbow/sil to pick N, measure clustering quality somehow
2. then add adjacent intervals together, so that we have 1/2 the number of
   intervals, each twice as long
3. goto step 1

At the end, pick the "best" interval length that produces the best clustering.

Then pick instrumentation points.
